# Before installation

You need to have a Fresh "blank" server installation. After that access your box using a SSH client, like PuTTY.
Warnings
If you don't know Linux ENOUGH:

DO NOT install this script on a non OVH Host. It is doable, but you'll have to know Linux to solve some problems.

DO NOT use capital letters, all your usernames should be written in lowercase. Passwords should NOT have spaces. Do NOT use words like root or shadow.

DO NOT upgrade anything in your box, ask in the thread before even thinking about it.

DO NOT try to reconfigure packages using other tutorials.

## How to install ?

That is the question you must ask yourself.
You must be logged in as root to run this installation or use sudo on it.
Commands

After installing you will have access to the following commands to be used directly in terminal

    createSeedboxUser
    deleteSeedboxUser
    changeUserPassword  [ changeUserPassword <username> <NewPassword> rutorrent ]
    installRapidleech
    installOpenVPN
    installSABnzbd
    installWebmin
    updategitRepository
    removeWebmin
    installRTorrent
    installZNC - Let the script complete and reboot, then run this command
    restartSeedbox
    installSUBSONIC
    installSICKRAGE
    installPLEX  
    speedTEST
    iptodomain

    While executing them, if sudo is needed, they will ask for a password.

Quota

Quota is disabled by default in your box. To enable and use it, you'll have to open Webmin, using the address you can find in one of the tables box above this. After you sucessfully logged on Webmin, enable it by clicking

System => Disk and Network Filesystems => /home => Use Quotas? => Select "Only User" => Save

Now you'll have to configure quota for each user, doing

System => Disk Quotas => /home => => Configure the "Soft kilobyte limit" => Update

As soon as you save it, your seedbox will also update the available space to all your users.
Changelog

Take a look at seedbox-from-scratch.sh and github commit history, it's all there.
